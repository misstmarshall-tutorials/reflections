How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was a lot faster and helps weed out the unnecessary lines of code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can quickly go back to an old version if something breaks.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    User error, confusion, too much or too little going on to understand change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some files may require other files to be changed as a result of it's change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the list of commits and git diff shows what was added and deleted between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can easily undo mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    idk
