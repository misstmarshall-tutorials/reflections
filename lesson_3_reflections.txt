When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are collaborating with others or need to access your files when away from the computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Just in case there are conflicts and to keep your original versions when others make changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches extend your current branch either locally or to a different location, clones makes a copy of a repository locally or from a different location, fork makes a copy of a gitHub repository to another gitHub location

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you'll know how to merge your new chanegs together

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    email would be hard, google drive would be a tad bit better, drop box might be the best I can think of

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when you want to confirm that what you want to add wont conflict with something someone else is working on
